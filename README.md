Windows Azure storage async extensions
======================================

*Adds -Async extension methods to enable use of the convenient C#/VB await
keywords when calling into Azure storage.*

This project is available as the 
[Microsoft.WindowsAzure.StorageClient.Async][1] NuGet package.

The API that Windows Azure Storage exposes is large, and this project is
currently under passive development (API is added on an as-needed basis).
Please consider [forking this project on GitHub][2] to add whatever -Async
methods that are missing that you want, and sending a pull request to get your
improvements added to the original project.
